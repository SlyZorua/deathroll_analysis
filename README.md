# What is "Death Rolling"? 
"Death Rolling" is a particularly common gambling game in World of Warcraft (particularly in main cities) in which two players (sometimes more) will roll from 100 to 1 (rolling from 9999 to 1 is also common). The previous roll becomes the upper bound of the next roll. The first player to roll a 1 loses and trades an agreed amount of in-game Gold to the other player.

Here is an example game between two players:

You can play and simulate a single death roll game yourself by executing the `deathroll_game.py` script :)
