# What is "Death Rolling"? 
"Death Rolling" is a particularly common gambling game in World of Warcraft (particularly in main cities) in which two players (sometimes more) will roll from 100 to 1 (rolling from 9999 to 1 is also common). The previous roll becomes the upper bound of the next roll. The first player to roll a 1 loses and trades an agreed amount of in-game Gold to the other player.

Here is an example game between two players:

You can play and simulate a single death roll game yourself by downloading executing the `deathroll_game.py` script with Python installed.

`deathroll_analysis.ipynb` is a Python Jupyter Notebook file, you can view its contents by clicking it above. 

If you'd like to run your own simulations, download `deathroll_analysis.ipynb` and open it in Jupyter Notebook or in Visual Studio Code, or any text editor of your choice that can interpret ipynb files. You will have to install a few packages to Python before you can run the code. To do this, open Command Promp then type:

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install numpy`

If you have issues with pip, you may need to install pip and/or ipython like so:

`pip install pip`

`pip install PyPi`

If you are using Conda and somehow don't have these packages pre-installed, copy the same steps as above but instead type them into the Anaconda Prompt.
